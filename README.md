# Deloitte Financial Analyst Externship – Daikibo Telemetry Project (May 2025)

This project was completed as part of a Deloitte Financial Analyst Externship. I analyzed machine telemetry data from four Daikibo manufacturing plants to determine operational inefficiencies and identify the location and equipment type with the highest rate of breakdowns.

## 🌍 Project Scope

**Factories analyzed:**
- Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
- Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
- Berlin (Germany)
- Shenzhen (China)

**Machine data:**
- 9 machine types
- 10-minute telemetry intervals
- Full month of May 2021

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Identify which location had the most frequent machine breakdowns.
- Determine which specific machine types failed most often at the problem location.
- Develop insights to inform operational risk mitigation strategies.

## 📊 Tools & Skills Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Excel
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dashboard design

## 📁 Files

- `EqualityTable-Completed.xslx` – Completed analysis of gender pay equality across job roles and locations using forensic algorithm outputs.
- `Daikibo-Telemetry-Data.json` – Raw output from the forensic algorithm containing gender pay equality scores by role and location.
- `Daikibo_Equality_Dashboard.pdf` – Tableau dashboard visualizing gender pay equality scores by role and factory location, with interactive filters for deeper DEI insights.
- `Deloite_Externship_Certificate.pdf` - Certificate of completion for the Deloitte Australia Data Analysis Job Simulation

## 📈 Results

- Most breakdowns occurred at the **Shenzhen** facility.
- **Machine Type 4** had the highest failure rate at that location.
- Recommendations included preventive maintenance scheduling and machine replacement strategy.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to derive operational insights from high-frequency telemetry data.
- The importance of data wrangling in cross-location manufacturing analytics.
- Communicating technical findings in a business-friendly format.
